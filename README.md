# Otter, a toy Game Engine

## Broad Goals:
- Implement a basic system for supporting game the development of a 3D game.
- Write everything from scratch, except for certain basic functions from the C Standard Library.

### Note:
  Platform abstraction is done through the use of a 3rd party library (Final Platform Layer), with extended development features supported only on windows - this was done so I that I have a jumo to build on to focus on learning other things such as rendering, collisions, asset loading, compression, etc. In the future, I plan on removing this dependancy as well.

## To build:
  1. edit the second line of build_dll and build_full.bat to reflect the location of vcvarsall.bat in your machine
  2. run build_full.bat

## Progress
